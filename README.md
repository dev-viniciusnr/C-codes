# C Codes

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises and assignments developed during my time at university.  
They were created as part of various academic subjects related to programming fundamentals, algorithms, and systems development.

The content covers key topics such as:
- Variables, data types, and control structures
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays, pointers, and memory handling
- Structs and file operations

This code represents my learning process in C during the early stages of my software development journey.
